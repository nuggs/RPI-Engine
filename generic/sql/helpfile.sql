('Skills','Information','\nLists all skills known to the character, and their degree\nof proficiency.\n\nShadows of Isildur is a skills-based MUD, without classes\nor character levels. A player, in theory, may learn any skill,\nand all skills only increase through actual use. As you get\nbetter at a skill, you may need to find more difficult\nchallenges to test the skill and increase it.\n\nWhen a skill is learned, it opens at a value that depends\nupon your character attributes. The rate that skills advance\nalso depends upon your character\'s attributes. All skills\nhave a cap which, not surprisingly, is also determined by\nyour character\'s statistics.\n\nThe level of skill proficiency is designated in four levels:\nNovice, Familiar, Adroit, and Master. Once your character\nreaches familiar in a skill, they can then learn other skills\nthat require that particular skill as a prerequisite. Once a\nskill reaches the level of Adroit, your character will be\nable to teach it to other characters.\n\nNote that, like in real life, finding anyone who has truly\nmastered a given skill is rare; most characters won\'t reach\nmastery in any at all. Some will master a single skill; it is a\nvery rare character indeed who masters more than that.\n\n','Leveling',0,'Mon May 20 12:12:48 2002','Traithe'),
('Emote','Communication','Usage: emote <message>\r\n\r\nThis command is used to make physical expressions which are\r\nnot adequately covered by existing socials.

('Nod','Communication','Usage: nod <doorkeeper> <direction>\r\n\r\nNormally, NOD is a social.

('Scribe','Communication','\nUsage: scribe <language>\n\nSimilar to the SPEAK command, scribe allows you to choose\nwhich known language your character will write in.

('Talk','Communication','See the entry for the SAY command; they are used in\r\nprecisely the same way, in most cases.\r\n\r\nThe one difference between them being that if you are\r\nseated at a table, and wish to lower your voice so that\r\nonly others at your table will likely be able to hear,\r\nyou should use this command as opposed to SAY.\r\n\r\nTALK will accomplish the same thing when used in\r\ngroups as well, even if you aren\'t at a table.\r\n\r\n','Group Murmur Say',0,'Tuesday, 04:41:33 am, 29th March 2005','Traithe'),
('Tell','Communication','\nUsage: tell <person> <message>\n\nTell is a sort of \"directed say\". It is often used in\nlarge groups of people, to make it easy to discern\nprecisely who remarks are intended for.\n\n','Ooc Reply',0,'Mon May 20 12:50:30 2002','Traithe'),
('Think','Communication','\nUsage: think <message>\n\nThe think command is used when your character is engaged in\nany pursuit which might be questionable if viewed by an admin,\nor when you, the player, wish to transmit certain information\nwhich might explain an action, behavior, or attitude.\n\n#1This command is NOT to be used in place of the PETITION\ncommand; any out-of-character thoughts will either be entirely\nignored by the admins, or punished harshly, depending upon\nthe offender and the situation.#0\n\n','Plan',0,'Mon May 20 13:11:37 2002','Traithe'),
('Voice','Communication','\nUsage: voice <string>\n\nRather like a \"vmote\", or \"voice emote\", the voice command\nallows you to specify a string that will be appended to your\ncharacter\'s speech.

Secondly, if the target is a book item, and\nthat book is currently open, the tear command will remove the\npage it is currently open to and convert it to a separate\nparchment item.

('Mounts','Movement','Mounts may be acquired via various means in-game, generally by\r\npurchase at a stable, kennel, or marketplace. The most common\r\nmounts in Gondor are horses, whereas the most common in Mordor\r\nare wargs.\r\n\r\nWhen you purchase a mount you are able to name it; the syntax\r\nis \"buy <mount> <desired name>\"; since mounts are saved along\r\nwith your pfile, this tag will be permanent, so choose wisely.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you purchase a mount, an \"owner flag\" is set\r\nthat will allow you, and only you, to use the COMMAND command on\r\nyour mount as if you were its clan leader. Ideal uses for the\r\nflag include emotes for the mount, issuing the needed commands\r\nto equip it, setting its combat mode, and so forth.\r\n\r\nIn town, mounts can (and should) be stabled. There is a 20\r\ncopper fee to stable your mount, which represents the wealth\r\nnecessary to maintain, feed, and care for it. Stabling your\r\nmount will ensure that it remains safe, along with any gear\r\nyou have stored in saddlebags or other containers on it. It\'s\r\npossible to have this fee bypassed through an agreement with\r\nthe stable or kennel owner, or if your clan provides a stable\r\nfor its members\' mounts.\r\n\r\nWhile mounts are flagged stayput, and thus persist while in-game\r\nover reboots, crashes have proven to defeat the stayput code\r\nin the past. Therefore, while we will restore a mount that is\r\nlost due to a crash -while you are online-, we will not do so\r\nfor mounts that are lost due to being in-game while you are not.\r\nThus, it is always wise to stable your mount before logging out.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to have your character log out along with your\r\nmount via the camping code, but this is not allowed with a\r\nsimple QUIT, and is generally to be done only rarely.\r\n\r\nNote that mounts will not heal their wounds while you are not\r\nin-game if saved via CAMP, whereas they will recover fairly \r\nquickly whilst stabled.\r\n\r\n','Bridle Hitch Mount Put Take',0,'Monday, 11:26:44 am, 14th August 2006','Frisia'),

('Aim','Combat','Usage: aim (<direction>) <target>\r\n\r\nUsing this command, characters wielding a loaded missile\r\nweapon may take aim at a target, either in their room or\r\nin a room within range.

Flee is a\ncontinuous command, meaning that you\'ve only the need to type it\nonce in combat to begin searching for an escape route.

('Hit','Combat','Usage: hit <target>\r\n\r\nThis is the primary way to initiate combat that is not intended\r\nto be brought to a lethal end. When hit is used to instigate\r\ncombat with another character or mobile, your character will stop\r\nattacking when the target drops to the ground, near death. While\r\nhit will generally not cause death, the target\'s safety is by\r\nno means guaranteed; accidents do happen.\r\n\r\nUnlike KILL, when you HIT someone, you will accept their\r\nsurrender if they make an attempt to do so. Further, clanned\r\nNPC mobiles will react differently to someone hitting you than\r\nsomeone attempting to kill you; hence, the HIT command\r\nshould ALWAYS be used in sparring, and not KILL.\r\n\r\nNote that, universally, hitting is thought of as assault, and\r\nthus a character who goes around assaulting others will likely\r\nbe seen committing a potentially fatal crime when in lawful areas.\r\n\r\nThere is no automatic knockout skill as of this time.\r\n\r\n','Kill Stop Surrender',0,'Sunday, 09:47:30 am, 27th February 2005','Cas'),

Rescue cannot be used to protect a companion\nwho isn\'t being attacked; for this, use the GUARD command.\n\nIf the rescue attempt fails, repeated attempts will be made\nevery few seconds until nobody is fighting.

('Treat','General','Usage: treat <person> <area>\r\n\r\nThe treat command allows a PC to utilize his or her Healing\r\nskill to tend to the specified person\'s wounds. Note that a\r\nremedy must be held when the command is issued in order\r\nfor it to work. Once the command is given, you will begin\r\ntreating every wound in that area; the delay for each wound\r\nwill be based on its severity and your skill. Once a wound\r\nis treated, any infection it has will soon subside, and its\r\nrate of healing will increase by a substantial amount.\r\n\r\nThe <area> argument must be given in a very specific form:\r\nif the targeted area is one of a pair (e.g. the left eye),\r\nthe word must begin with \"l\" or \"r\". Then, the name of the\r\narea itself should be specified. For example:\r\n\r\n  > treat traithe leye\r\n  > treat traithe rforearm\r\n  > treat traithe thorax\r\n  > treat traithe lupperarm\r\n\r\nBotching a treatment attempt on a wound may cause additional \r\ndamage, as well as potentially causing infection. The failed \r\ntreatment will prevent further treatment, until a certain period \r\nof time has elapsed. \r\n\r\nA failed attempt will show the wound as #4(tended)#0, whereas a \r\nsuccessful one will show as #6(treated)#0. Healers using diagnose \r\nwill see results such as #6(poorly treated)#0, #6(treated)#0, or \r\n#6(expertly treated)#0. \r\n\r\nAny infections in a successfully treated wound will subside\r\nupon the next healing pulse, and that wound will heal at an\r\nincreased rate, depending upon the skill of the healer.\r\n\r\nNote that while this command does stop a wound from bleeding,\r\nthe delay involved may be somewhat prohibitive -- you would\r\nbe well advised to use the BIND command, to prevent your\r\npatient from bleeding to death.\r\n\r\nNote that there isn\'t much one can do about rather minor wounds,\r\nand so the TREAT command will tend to skip over them.\r\n\r\n','Bind Diagnose Healing Health Illness Remedy',0,'Friday, 06:04:04 am, 8th June 2007','Bristlecone'),

('Coins','General','Traditionally, coins in MUDs have come in either one of two forms.\r\n\r\nIn a lot of the older DIKU derivatives, coins are simply a number\r\nstored in a character, representing that character\'s net wealth.\r\nThe advantage of this is that you don\'t need to do things like\r\nfumble through your pouches when you buy something, or pay a\r\ntoll; you simply buy it, and the appropriate number is deducted.\r\nThe disadvantage is that this sort of a system precludes a lot\r\nof coin-related RP, as well as the theft of a player\'s coin.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some MUDs represent coins as in-game objects,\r\nthat players can store in their containers. This presents the\r\nconverse of the above; it aids in roleplay, but it can be\r\nsomewhat cumbersome when buying and selling things.\r\n\r\nHere at Shadows of Isildur, we have a system that combines the\r\nbest of both worlds. Coins are represented as various in-game\r\nobjects (see HELP CURRENCY), which are stored in a player\'s\r\ncontainers. However, when you go to buy something, for example,\r\nyou need not remove them and have them in your hands; the\r\ncode will automatically search through all your containers to\r\nfind your coins. Likewise, when you sell something, the code\r\nwill automatically place the coins gained from the transaction\r\nin the first container found currently carrying other coins.\r\n\r\nIf, for some reason, you wish to preserve a certain coin, and\r\nhave the code ignore it, you will need to place it in a\r\n\"nested\" container, e.g. inside a pouch within a backpack.\r\n\r\n','Count Currency',0,'Sunday, 01:30:03 am, 27th June 2004','Traithe'),

('Shops','Building','\nThe following describes the procedure to build a shop:\n\n1) You must first have, at the very least, a mob initialized.\n   If you plan on having your shop within a room, i.e. stationary,\n   you should also have that room number initialized. You should\n   also know what sort of items your shop will buy and sell; food,\n   weapons, etc...\n\n2) Use the MSET KEEPER command to initialize the shopkeeper. If\n   this is not a newly created mob, you will probably want to\n   start editing it with MOB <vnum>. If the shop is a room, the\n   FLAG of the keeper should include Sentinel. Leave this flag out\n   if you wish to make a wandering merchant. For the sake of simplicity\n   you might want to consider making a mob with the same v-number as\n   the room his shop is located in.\n\n3) Next, RINIT the storeroom. A shop keeper does not keep his goods\n   in his inventory; all items are placed in the storeroom. ALL\n   storerooms should be located in zone 0.\n\n4) Now use the \"LOAD obj <obj vnum>\" inside your storeroom to place\n   the items for sale in your shopkeeper\'s listing. A shop should\n   generally not contain more than 6-7 items; this will provide the\n   player a decent amount of variety, while not giving him or her\n   access to too many items in one location. Now, when you type \"list\"\n   in the same room as your shopkeeper, you should see all the items\n   you just loaded into his storeroom.\n\n5) A shop can \"reproduce\" an unlimited supply of up to five items. This\n   adds a bit of \"reality\" to the game. If you were in a tavern, you\n   should be able to purchase more than one tankard of ale. The MSET\n   DELIVERY command allows you to specify which items you want your\n   shop to reproduce. Note: Some discretion should be used in specifying\n   which items will be reproduced. For example, it would be common for\n   a keeper to reproduce an unlimited supply of ale, but not for a\n   weapons-maker to reproduce the finest chainmail, or the best sword,\n   without limit. Therefore, do not set \"quality\", \"complex\", or \"unique\"\n   items with MSET DELIVERY.\n\n6) To set the types of items a shop will purchase from players, use the\n   MSET BUY command. Note: Some items should not be set with BUY --\n   trash, food, other, and note. However, setting these items to not be\n   bought with MSET NOBUY is a good idea.\n\n7) Another thing to set when making a shop is its buy and sell profit\n   values. The MSET DISC command sets the percent value that the keeper\n   will try to purchase the item for. Example: MSET DISC 0.75 would mean\n   that the shopkeeper would try to buy an item off the player at 75% of\n   its real value. Similarly, with MSET MARK 1.1, the keeper will try to\n   sell the item at 10% more than its cost.\n\n','(null)',1,'Sat May 14 00:08:53 2003','Traithe'),

('Ovals','Building','\nMeanings of ovals by item-type:\n\nLight\n   oval0:  Color (not implemented)\n   oval1:  Type  (not implemented)\n   oval2:  Mud hours of life in light.\n   \nWeapon\n   oval0:\n      0 - primary hand\n      1 - secondary hand\n      2 - either hand\n      3 - two-handed\n   oval1:  # dice in damage  2 in 2d4\n   oval2:  # sides on dice   4 in 2d4\n   oval3:  obsoleted. Use \'oset type <skill-name>\' to determine type\n   oval4:  What sort of hit the weapon makes (has slightly different\n           affects on different armors):\n           0 - stab\n           1 - pierce\n           2 - chop\n           3 - bludgeon\n           4 - slash\n   oval5:  Adjustment to base on hand for this weapon.  NOTE:  Base delays\n           are based on oval3.  For instance, a sword (3) might have a \n           delay of 4 seconds, and a dagger (4) has a base delay of 3\n           seconds.  The oval5 is an adjustment to this base delay, either\n           positive or negative in quarter seconds.  So, if you have a\n           really fast dagger, you might put -2 in oval5, meaning 1/2\n           second faster than normal.\n\nMissile\n   oval1:  # dice in damage 2 in 2d4\n   oval2:  # sides in dice  4 in 2d4\n\nShield\n   No ovals used on shields.  To make a shield better, add a Block affect\n   modifier.\n   \nArmor\n   oval0:  Armor Value.  This is how much damage is obsorbed before\n           taking into account hit location.  For instance, when you are\n           hit in the neck with 5 points of damage, and you have armor\n           worth 3, then pre-hit location damage is 5-3=2.  (Multiplier\n           for being hit on the neck is 3...so your approximate damage\n           would be 2 x 3 = 6 (vs 5 x 3 = 15, which is what it would be\n           without armor).  There are other factors in damage too, which\n           aren\'t described here.\n   oval1:  Armor Type:\n           0 - quilted\n           1 - leather\n           2 - ring\n           3 - scale\n           4 - mail\n           5 - plate\n   oval5:  Is a pointer.

('Employment','General','The first thing to remember when talking about jobs is that Middle-earth \r\nis based on our earth\'s middle-ages. Even though Tolkien reduced (or \r\nmade no mention) of the daily cruelties that were quite usual, here in \r\nShadows of Isildur the times are indeed difficult, and money hard to come by.\r\n\r\nA first character never has roleplay points to spend, and sometimes, not even \r\nthe second one, or even third. For this reason, you, as the player, will have \r\nto make your character find a job so that he may be able to survive.\r\n\r\nApprenticeships cost either money or RP-points, but as the economy tries \r\nto become further player-driven, these might be easier to get.\r\n\r\nIt is highly unlikely that you will become a master with your first character,\r\nso you\'ll probably be stuck with a simple, low-grade, unskilled labour type \r\nof job.\r\n\r\nFor first players, it is recommended that they join the military, which \r\nrarely refuses anyone (the need is great). You will not get a pay as soon \r\nas you join, but you will get food, shelter, and basic equipment. If your \r\nduty proves to be at least decent, and more importantly, if you manage \r\nto survive the first few in-game months, you\'ll be promoted and get a \r\nsimple pay. For this job, you should select at least one weapon-skill, and \r\na few others you think might help in the military.\r\n\r\nThere is also another simple choice, the hunter. It is less recommended \r\nthan the soldier because you will have much less interaction with other \r\nPC\'s. It\'s much more lonely; you hunt alone, whereas in the military you\'re \r\neither on patrol with fellow soldiers, or stuck inside a bastion with soldiers \r\nall around you. The hunter should be very careful as to where he chooses to \r\nhunt. For Gondorians, hunting eastward is certain death, especially at \r\nnight. Westward, however, in the Pelennor Fields and surroundings, there \r\nis some game to be found and taken down. Mind, however, that you will \r\nnot find deer by the dozens as you stroll through miles of plains or small \r\nwoodings, far from it. It is hard to spot decent prey, and sometimes you \r\nmight find nothing. Rabbits are easier to come by, for example, but provide \r\nobviously much less income.\r\n\r\nA hunter should chose a bow skill (and be aware that hunters did not hunt \r\nwith swords or spears), and the tracking skill, as you will be able to use it \r\nto find paw-prints of animals and follow them. Skinning is also essential, \r\nso that you may separate corpse from hide and sell them both, or sell the \r\nhide and cook the meat (for which you might need the cookery skill).\r\n\r\nA number of other unskilled jobs have been added and programmed, \r\nsuch as dock-worker. These are generally very easy to accomplish, \r\nbut the drawback is that you will get barely enough to sustain yourself, \r\nlet alone family or housing.\r\n\r\nDepending on the skills you\'ve chosen, you may look to work as a\r\nleatherworker, a clothier, a blacksmith, or some of the like. For this, \r\nit is very strongly recommended that you resort to other PC\'s, who will \r\ntry to employ you (but notice that they might not have the coin to give \r\nyou a constant pay. They might be in the same situation as you!) in \r\nreturn for these services. Know that you cannot sell your crafted wares \r\nto the public without a Fellowship\'s license, so you will work for someone, \r\nand hand the crafted goods to them, and no one else.\r\n\r\nYou\'ll still need to know how to get into the military, for example, as in \r\nthis case you\'ll be a subordinate, and there are other players involved. \r\nThe most common meeting place is the tavern. Even if a player doesn\'t \r\nfrequent it all the time, he\'s bound to heard the latest rumours and gossip. \r\nYou\'ll notice there is an object representing the patrons of the inn. If you \r\ntype \"look patrons\", you\'ll see a board system where you can read and leave \r\nyour own messages. You should always roleplay the messages you leave, so \r\nkeep that in mind. You can \"read #\" to read the messages, and \"write \r\n<topic>\" to enter the text editor and leave your own.\r\n\r\nThis is if there is noone around that can help you. Always make sure there\r\nisn\'t. Try making conversation with a few other patrons, getting to know the \r\nother characters so that you have contacts that can help you in tight\r\nsituations, and who might point you to the right direction (namely, an\r\nemployer). Look at people. Soldiers are quite easily spotted, they\'re in \r\narmour. They\'ll either recruit you if you talk to them, or try to bring someone\r\nwho might recruit you.\r\n\r\nIf you come across the character name of one who might be interesting in \r\nemploying you, then hobbit-mail them. Hobbit-mail is OOC, so explain that \r\nyou\'re looking for a job and want to set up a meeting time so the two \r\ncharacters can meet and see if it\'s possible.\r\n\r\nYou should try this for at least a real-life week before resorting to emailing \r\nthe staff, or to petition to get shopkeepers animated to get you a job. Shadows \r\nof Isildur is about player interaction, and if you\'re alone with an NPC, it\r\nwon\'t be very fun for you, and you\'ll be reducing other\'s possibilities for\r\nenjoyment as well. Always look to Player Characters first.\r\n\r\n','Newbie',0,'Sunday, 03:32:22 pm, 31st October 2004','Frisia'),

In general, the four main crafts are\n+ \"pilfer\", which involves selecting a healthy animal from a nest.\n+ \"cage\", which involves transferring the captured animal to a cage.\n+ \"train\", which involves feeding, caring, and training the caged animal.\n+ \"release\", which involves opening the cage and seeing if the animal\nis willing to do your bidding or not.\nSome animals have numerous stages of training required, such as\nbaby wargs maturing in to young wargs. Some animals have different\nlevels of training at which they can be released. A careful perusal\nof the materials of each craft, and the taming crafts as listed on\nthe Crafts website page will reveal the full extent to which each\nanimal can be trained.\nTraining an animal takes time, and resources. Leaving an animal\nunfed for a prolonged time can result in the animal becoming unruly\nand reversing previous training, or even eventually dying of starvation.\nLikewise, a seeming tame animal may rebel during the final stages\nof taming in an attempt to escape.\n\nOnce released, a tamed animal will be able to be commanded by the\ntrainer. However, different animals will have different abilities\nand skills; some animals may flee at the first sign of violence,\nothers defend their masters to the death. Currently, admin intervention\nis required to transfer command of one animal to another.

('Fellowships','Clans','On Fellowships in General\r\n\r\nThere are fifteen Fellowships in Minas Tirith. These are akin to \r\nmedieval guilds and the Efreahir of the Northmen, but are far \r\nless restrictive and formal. Effectively they serve two purposes: \r\nto gather together workers producing similar sorts of goods so \r\nthat the economies of having a communal workplace are achieved, \r\nand also to provide a fellowship, a sort of club that workers in \r\nthat industry can join in order to gain political and social \r\nbenefits. The social benefits include looking after widows and \r\norphans of workers and, on a much lighter note, revelries and \r\nget-togethers of like-minded fellows (and ladies) after a hard \r\nday\'s work.\r\n\r\nIn general, there are three distinctions within the Fellowships;\r\nApprentices, Journeymen, and full-fledged Masters. A Master is\r\nreferred to by the title of his Fellowship, e.g. \'Baker\',\r\n\'Weaponsmith\', \'Healer\', and so on. Apprentices and Journeymen \r\nhave no title, and their periods of training vary by their trade.\r\n\r\nEach Fellowship possesses its own Deputy Master, or Headmaster. \r\nThese fifteen Deputies constitute a larger Committee of \r\nFellowships, which govern the organizations collectively. The\r\nCommitee is run by a Grandmaster, who is elected by the Committee\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIdeally, apprenticeship begins anywhere from the young age of 10 \r\nfor the more \'learned\' guilds such as the Sages and Healers, to \r\nthe more seasoned age of 14 for the more \'physical\' guilds such \r\nas the Metalsmiths or Armorsmiths. Depending upon the trade, it \r\nwill last anywhere from 1-3 years.\r\n\r\nJourneymanship is a period of time during which the individual is \r\nable to travel and serve under Fellows of their own choosing, \r\nprovided they are able to take on another pupil. While not crafters \r\nin their own right, journeyman are valued for their (often \r\nunderpaid) assistance in running shops and businesses, and are \r\noccasionally granted the responsibility of running their own stall \r\nunder a Master\'s guidance. It usually lasts for a period of 2-3 \r\nyears, depending on trade.\r\n\r\nAfter having completed a stint of journeymanship satisfactorily\r\nwith one or more Master Fellows, the aspiring Journeyman, with the\r\nblessing of the aformentioned Master(s), submits a letter of \r\napplication to the Committee. The Committee reviews the application, \r\nand, if willing, demands a demonstration of competence from the \r\nJourneyman.

Here are a few examples:\r\n\r\n  > write commoners Some gossip is overheard...\r\n  > write board A scrawled note has been left here.\r\n\r\nThe second use of the command allows players to write actual\r\nnotes, via our new player writing system. Since no subject\r\nneeds to be specified, the syntax is simply \"write <object>\".\r\nEnsure that you are speaking the language you wish to write.\r\n\r\nNote that no matter what the size of the target object, only\r\none note may be written per page. Also, note that when writing\r\nto a book, you will write on the page that it is currently open\r\nto; use the FLIP command to change this page number.\r\n\r\nIn order to write this way, one must have a writing instrument\r\nof some sort, such as a quill, currently HELD; also, one must\r\nhave a vessel of ink, pigment, etc, in one\'s inventory or in\r\nthe room that you are in. Note that this is true no matter \r\nwhat medium you choose to write with. IE: If you want to use \r\nchalk, you will need a piece of chalk (writing instrument, a \r\nbox of chalk (vessel), and a slateboard. This is due to how\r\nthe code works and should NOT be roleplayed as being odd or\r\nconfusing in any way.\r\n\r\nThe WRITE command will always take you into a text editor, and\r\nyou will not see what happens around your character while you\r\nare in #1(edit)#0 mode.

In order\r\nto use the craft, at the prompt you would type:\r\n\r\n  > make rings\r\n\r\nThis would then begin the procedure; depending on whether or\r\nnot you have available the proper materials, and whether or not\r\nyou pass all applicable skill checks, you will succeed or fail.\r\n\r\n#6Note:#0 It is important to check what materials are required\r\nBEFORE starting to craft.

('Craft_branching','General','The Shadows of Isildur craft branching system is an extremely powerful\r\nand versatile piece of code. Unlike other MU*s, where characters tend\r\nto progress along static, pre-determined paths, our system of craft\r\nbranching is entirely dynamic - that is to say, when your character\r\nbranches a craft what s/he learns next is determined by a number of\r\nfluid factors beyond merely which subcraft s/he just completed. These\r\nfactors include your character\'s skill level, their race, their clan\r\naffiliations and ranks, and finally any items that are either REQUIRED\r\nor PRODUCED by the subcraft you just completed.\r\n\r\nThe order of precedence in craft branching is down, then up. Think\r\nof it this way; in order to create complex and interesting items,\r\nyour character must first learn the fundamentals.\r\n\r\nFor an example, let us examine the #6cast bronze-sword-guards#0 craft.\r\n\r\nThese sword guards are used in the creation of a number of different\r\nitems, ranging from practice blades to real weapons. However, before\r\nwe can fashion full blades from them, we must first learn to create\r\nthe wax crossguard required by the sword-guards craft itself. Thus,\r\nthe first time we branch a subcraft after successfully crafting a \r\nsword-guard, we will be given the #6pour wax-crossguard#0 technique.\r\n\r\nAfter learning to pour a wax-crossguard, if we pass another branch\r\ncheck with the bronze-sword-guards craft, the code will automatically\r\nlook UP the tree at what crafts require what we just produced, since\r\nwe now have all the crafts to produce what sword-guards REQUIRES.\r\n\r\nIn this case, it would immediately catch upon an #6assemble sword#0\r\ncraft. However, we don\'t quite know how to make all the ingredients\r\nrequired to assemble any sword yet; specifically, we\'ll still need\r\nto be able to forge a bronze pommel before doing so. Therefore, the\r\nsubcraft we branch second will be #6cast bronze-pommel#0.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass a branching check for the third time, rather like we\r\npreviously learned to pour the wax crossguard model, this time we will\r\nlearn the #6pour wax-pommel#0 subcraft to round out our knowledge.\r\n\r\nNow that we know how to construct the lower part of the sword, we\'ll\r\nnaturally progress to learning how to forge a blade; therefore, our\r\nfourth successful branching check will bring us #6forge longsword-blade.#0\r\n\r\nFinally, we have the fundamentals! Namely, cast bronze-sword-guards,\r\npour wax-crossguard, cast bronze-pommel, pour wax-pommel, and forge\r\nlongsword-blade. Therefore, upon passing a branch check after using \r\nANY of these crafts, we will finally learn the \"crown jewel\", so to \r\nspeak: #6assemble longsword#0. Because our system is dynamic and\r\ntherefore intelligent in a way static progressions are not, it means\r\nthat no matter where you start along the \"tree\" of the #6assemble\r\nlongsword#0 craft, you will fill it out completely and eventually\r\nreach the apex. See the diagram below:\r\n\r\n                           #6assemble longsword#0\r\n                                    ^\r\n                                    |\r\n                          #6forge longsword-blade#0\r\n                                    ^\r\n                                    |\r\n              ----------------------------------------------\r\n              |                                            |\r\n   #6cast bronze-sword-guards#0                       #6cast bronze-pommel#0\r\n              ^                                            ^\r\n              |                                            |\r\n     #6pour wax-crossguard#0                            #6pour wax-pommel#0\r\n                                                            \r\nThe power of this system of branching lies in its dynamism and its\r\nfluidity. Thus, the branching path demonstrated above will not always\r\napply to all characters; depending upon which specific crafts they use \r\nin which order, and what their skill levels are, they may learn to forge\r\nshortswords first, or even practice blades. The only constant is that\r\nthe system will automatically search for any related crafts that you\r\nqualify to be assigned -before- it opens a random new craft for you.\r\n\r\nThe only circumstance in which you will branch an entirely unrelated\r\nsubcraft is if the system can find no subcrafts related to the one you\r\njust completed for which you qualify. The echo you receive when you\r\nactually branch a craft will inform you whether or not the new craft\r\nis related to what you just completed, or if it is entirely new.\r\n\r\nNote that even when the code assigns random, unrelated crafts, there\r\nare still requirements that those crafts may or may not have; thus,\r\nApprentices will not mysteriously branch Master-level crafts, Goblins\r\nwill not learn to make Elvish blades, and so on.\r\n\r\nFinally, please note that craft branching ONLY applies to other\r\nsubcrafts within the craft category of the subcraft you completed\r\nbefore passing your branch check. Therefore, weaponcraft subcrafts \r\nwill only branch into other weaponcraft subcrafts, hunting craft\r\nsubcrafts will only branch into other hunting craft subcrafts, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to learn more subcrafts in a category, you must use the\r\nopening crafts you are given (those marked with an asterisk on the\r\nfull crafts listing on our website), and practice them diligently.\r\n\r\n','Crafts Teach',0,'Friday, 01:56:50 pm, 30th April 2004','Traithe'),

If \r\nthere is more than one piece of furniture in the room, you can \r\nsee a list of it by typing TABLES.\r\n\r\nThe STAND command has another use - it can be used to position \r\nyourself at the edge of a room, so you can easily LOOK into any \r\nadjacent room. To use it, STAND <direction>.\r\n\r\n#6Communication#0\r\n\r\nEMOTE - This command allows you to have your character perform \r\nan action. Anyone else in the room will see the specified action. \r\nFor example, if #5a bald, fat man#0 typed this:\r\n\r\nemote pretends to be a camel.\r\n\r\nthe rest of the room would see:\r\n\r\n#5A bald, fat man#0 pretends to be a camel.\r\n\r\nTo specify another player or item in an emote, use a tilde (for \r\nplayers or mobs) or asterisk (for items) before the player or \r\nitem\'s keyword. If #5a bald, fat man#0 is in a room with \r\n#5a thin, red-haired woman#0 and a #2heavy, iron anvil#0, and \r\ntypes:\r\n\r\nemote sits down on *anvil, shaking his head at (tilde)woman.\r\n\r\nthe rest of the room would see:\r\n\r\n#5A bald, fat man#0 sits down on #2a heavy, iron anvil#0, shaking \r\nhis head at #5a thin, red-haired woman#0.\r\n\r\nSAY - The basic communication command, SAY lets you send a message \r\nto  the rest of the room. To precede the say with an emote, place \r\nthe emote in parenthesis before the message. #5A bald, fat man#0 \r\nmight type:\r\n\r\nsay (shaking his head) No, I don\'t like whiskey.\r\n\r\nand the rest of the room would see:\r\n\r\n#5A bald, fat man#0 says in Westron, shaking his head,\r\n   \"No, I don\'t like whiskey.\"\r\n\r\nIf you are able to speak more than one language, you can change \r\nwhich language you are speaking in by typing SPEAK <language>.\r\n\r\nTALK - If you are seated at a table, the TALK command will send a \r\nmessage only to those who are seated at the same table. Others in \r\nthe room, if skilled at listening, may overhear fragments of your \r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nTELL - The tell command is like SAY, but targets another player \r\nspecifically. Simply put the player\'s (or mob\'s) keyword before \r\nthe words to be spoken. The rest of the room WILL hear this message.\r\n\r\nWHISPER - The WHISPER command is like TELL, but sends a message \r\nto one other person ONLY, who you must target. For example, \r\n#5a bald, fat man#0 might type this:\r\n\r\nwhisper woman No, I don\'t like whiskey.\r\n\r\nThe woman would receive the message, while the rest of the room \r\nwould hear nothing (or receive only fragments).\r\n\r\nSHOUT - This command allows you shout, letting adjacent rooms \r\nhear your words. It works like SAY, but anyone in a nearby room \r\nwill be able to hear you (although they will not neccessarily know\r\nwho is shouting).\r\n\r\nTHINK - The THINK command lets you think a private message, which \r\nonly the administrators can see.\r\n\r\nNOTIFY - You can use this command to notify entire clans or specific \r\npeople, letting them know you\'re online and looking for roleplay. \r\nConversely, you can also use this to respond to a notify sent to you,\r\nletting the notifier know you\'re online.\r\n\r\nPETITION - PETITION is an Out of Character method of communication \r\nwith the administrators. You may:\r\n\r\npetition all <message>\r\n\r\nto address all administrators online at the time, or\r\nto target a specific one:\r\n\r\npetition Traithe <message>\r\n\r\nHOBBITMAIL - Accessible via option H from the account login menu, \r\nHobbitmail can be used to communicate with other players. It\'s a \r\ngreat way to contact clan leaders or people you need to speak with \r\nICly, and set up times to catch them online and RP.\r\n\r\n#6Information#0\r\n\r\nSCORE - SCORE shows you the statistics of your character;\r\nyour name, age, a rough estimate of your physical attributes,\r\nwhether you are hungry or thirsty, and other helpful things.\r\n\r\nCOUNT - This command searches through all the containers worn\r\non your person and counts up the coins you have. This takes a\r\nlittle bit of time to do, so be patient.\r\n\r\nINVENTORY, EQUIPMENT - These commands let you see what you\'re\r\nwearing and holding.\r\n\r\nTIME - This shows you the IC time and date, currently, in the game.\r\n\r\nWEATHER - If you are outside, this command gives you information\r\nabout the current weather.\r\n\r\nSEARCH - This command allows you to search a room for hidden\r\nobjects or players, and can also be used to search a direction for\r\nhidden exits. To do this, simply SEARCH <direction>.\r\n\r\nSKILLS - Shows you a list of the skills you currently know, and a rough\r\nestimate of how good you are at them.\r\n\r\n#6Manipulation#0\r\n\r\nGET - This will pick up an object in the room, or take an item from\r\na container. To do this, simply GET <item> or GET <item> <container>.\r\nRemember that you can only hold two items at a time, one in each\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nDROP, PUT - These commands are the opposite of GET, letting you\r\ndrop an item on the floor or put an item in a container. To put an item\r\ninto another, PUT <item> <container>.\r\n\r\nGIVE - GIVE allows you to pass an item from your possession to another\'s.\r\nTo use it, GIVE <item> <player>.\r\n\r\nOPEN, CLOSE - These commands allow you to open or close doors,\r\ngates, curtains, and the like. If there is more than one door in a room,\r\nyou can OPEN <door> <direction>. You may also have to open or\r\nclose certain containers.\r\n\r\nKNOCK - This allows you to knock on a door, letting anybody behind\r\nit know that someone\'s there. To use it, KNOCK <door> or\r\nKNOCK <door> <direction>.\r\n\r\nEAT, DRINK - Use these commands to eat or drink an item you\'re holding,\r\nor to take a drink from a nearby water source, such as a well or fountain.\r\n\r\nFILL - Fill is used to fill a drink container from a water source. Simply\r\nFILL <container> <water source>.\r\n\r\nLIGHT - This command can be used to light a candle, torch, lantern, or\r\nother light source. To extinguish the light source, LIGHT <item> off.\r\n\r\nWEAR, WIELD - These commands allow you to manipulate objects\r\nin your possession. WEAR will wear a piece of clothing or armor on the\r\nappropriate place, and WIELD will brandish a weapon.\r\n\r\nSWITCH - Switch simply moves what you\'re holding in your left hand\r\nto your right, and vice versa.\r\n\r\n','Assist Built_areas Chargen Commence Employment Hints Mentor Roleplay-Points Roleplay-points',0,'Thursday, 09:21:50 am, 13th May 2004','Haiwolfe'),
('Writings','Staff','The WRITINGS command is the basic interface to the table in our database that\r\nstores all in-character player writings.

Once you are inside the water area, you may\r\nuse the standard directional commands to move about. Note that\r\nall water exits are displayed as #4blue#0 in your list of exits.\r\n\r\nSwimming, in most cases, is generally quite safe. The only time you\r\nwill encounter trouble is if you swim while encumbered, or if you\r\nbecome exhausted in the water. If this happens, you run the risk of\r\ndrowning - a slow but nevertheless quite deadly process.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, you may actually swim underwater, which will\r\nbe achieved by swimming into a room -below- the surface of the\r\nwater room you\'re in if such an exit is available. Once you do this,\r\nyou will notice that your prompt automatically extends itself,\r\nadding a set of cyan asterisks to the far right.\r\n\r\nThese asterisks are a representation of your held breath; they will\r\ncontinually run down while you are underwater, and you will need\r\nto re-surface to take in more breath once the meter becomes low.\r\n\r\nIf you completely deplete the meter while underwater (voluntarily\r\nor otherwise), your fatigue and your health will begin dropping at\r\na steady rate until you have drowned.\r\n\r\nYour SWIM skill plays into this system in a number of ways; it helps\r\ndetermine how quickly you move while swimming, how quickly your\r\nfatigue drops in the water, and for how long you can hold your breath.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself drowning due to the weight of your gear, you\r\nshould be sure to remove and drop the heaviest piece first; under\r\nthe water, the remove command has a delay, so if you remove a\r\nlight piece of gear you may waste time that your PC does not have.\r\n\r\nNote that it is possible to drown in a water room that does not have\r\na down exit into an underwater area - so be careful!\r\n\r\nAll that said, if you swim with a mind to realism and do so only\r\nafter divesting your PC of his or her equipment, it is quite a safe\r\npractice, and will hopefully provide roleplay opportunities.\r\n\r\n','Drowning',0,'Monday, 12:00:56 am, 18th October 2004','Traithe'),

('vNPC','General','The concept of a vNPC, or \"virtual non-player character\", is one that\r\nplayers new to RPI MUDs often have difficulty with. Nonetheless, they\r\nare a vitally important element in any roleplay, so please read on if\r\nyou have any questions and feel free to ask the staff if necessary.\r\n\r\nNPCs, or \"non-player characters\", are the creatures and people that\r\npopulate the gameworld. Represented identically to PCs, the only\r\ndifference is that in most cases they are controlled by the computer\r\nrather than a person, save when they are being animated by staff.\r\nNevertheless, our sophisticated AI routines will allow them to react\r\nintelligently in many situations; although you will never be able to\r\nhave conversations with them, you should certainly expect them to\r\ntake whatever measures necessary to safeguard their own lives\r\nshould you exhibit aggressive behavior toward them.\r\n\r\nA step removed, vNPCs are called \"virtual\" because they are not\r\nactually represented in-game with a mob. Examples of these\r\ninclude the people that would be hustling and bustling around a\r\nbusy market square during the day, the numerous soldiers going\r\nback and forth in a crowded barracks room, or even other patrons\r\nin a tavern your character is frequenting. The key to determining\r\nwhether there are any vNPCs present is a careful reading of the\r\nroom\'s description; if it seems like a place where there would be\r\npeople coming and going during the current time your PC is in\r\nthe room, then you can safely say there are vNPCs present.\r\n\r\nvNPCs are vital because it allows the game to retain continuity and\r\nrealism within the game setting without requiring that every single\r\nliving individual in a village of 20,000 be concretely represented.\r\nNot only would this get quite spammy and unpleasant for the player,\r\nbut it would also soak up an immense amount of system resources.\r\n\r\nAn effective and conscientious roleplayer will take into account\r\nthe presence of these virtual NPCs when conducting their PC;\r\nit\'s easy enough to do when you remember that the room\'s \r\ndescription is the key. In other words - read carefully!\r\n\r\n','',0,'Wednesday, 12:32:06 pm, 1st September 2004','Traithe'),

However, practising\r\nSLEIGHT will not increase your STEAL skill.\r\n\r\nAt its most basic, it may be used to either pick up a small object in\r\nthe room without an echo, or to do the same with an object inside\r\na container in the room (this will also work with objects on tables).\r\n\r\nSecondly, it may be used to insert or remove small objects from\r\ncontainers that you are wearing.

('Log','Staff','Usage: log (<search parameters>) <search term(s)>\r\n\r\nThe LOG command consists of two primary halves, the SEARCH\r\nPARAMETERS, and the SEARCH TERMS.\r\n\r\nSearch parameters are used to define the boundaries of the logs\r\nthat you are searching through. This can include things like the\r\nport you want to search, an account name you want to check the\r\nlogs for, a room number you want to see actions in, and so on.\r\nMost search parameters are divided into two halves; the parameter\r\nitself, and the input you wish to provide (i.e. \'port 4500\').\r\n\r\nSearch terms are the actual words you\'re looking for in the log\r\nentries. If you wish to use multiple terms, you\'ll need to include\r\nconnectors between them: either \'AND\' (or \'&\'), or \'OR\'. An AND\r\nconnector will only return results containing BOTH the words\r\nbefore and after it; an OR connector will return results containing\r\nEITHER word that comes before or after the connector.\r\n\r\nIf you do not provide any search terms it will return the entire\r\nset of results within the boundaries of whatever parameters you\r\nused. If you didn\'t specify ANYTHING, it will return with the\r\ntotal number of entries currently in the system logs.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that we store our logs for indefinite periods of\r\ntime, in order to ensure reasonable results the command will\r\ndefault to a backdate of 14 days if you don\'t specify another\r\nperiod of time with the DAYS, HOURS, or MINUTES parameters.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, if you do not specify an alternate set of logs (e.g.\r\nthe guest or staff logs), the command defaults to PC logs.\r\n\r\n#6Available Search Parameters:#0\r\n\r\nport <port ##> : Allows you to specify the port number for which\r\nyou wish to search the logs. This value defaults to the port that\r\nyou\'re currently connected to. Possible values: 4500, 4501.\r\n\r\nplayer <name> : Allows you to specify a specific PC\'s name, so\r\nthat the only entries searched will be commands entered by them.\r\n\r\naccount <name> : The same as the PLAYER parameter above,\r\nexcept that it will search lines for any character on the account.\r\n\r\nnpc <name> : Searches only log entries generated by the named\r\nNPC; the output includes the name of the imm animating it.\r\n\r\ncommand <command> : Searches only log entries generated by\r\nthe specified command. Note that all commands are expanded\r\nby the parser before being logged - e.g. a \'command emote\' will\r\nturn up someone who enters \'emo does a little dance.\' Commands are\r\nstored in a separate field from their arguments to ensure that you \r\ncan, for example, search for the think command without turning \r\nup log lines like \'say I think I\'m a clueless moron.\'\r\n\r\nroom <room ##> : Only returns log entries generated in the\r\nspecified room.\r\n\r\nminutes <X> : Only searches log entries generated within the\r\nlast X minutes.\r\n\r\nhours <X> : Only searches log entries generated within the last\r\nX hours.\r\n\r\ndays <X> : Only searches log entries generated within the last\r\nX days.\r\n\r\nguest : Searches through the guest log for the specified terms.\r\n\r\nimmortal : Searches through the staff log for the specified terms.\r\nNote that only level 5 staff members can access this.\r\n\r\nsystem : Searches through the system log for the specified terms.\r\n\r\nerror : Searches through the system log for the specified terms,\r\nand will only return entries flagged as critical errors.\r\n\r\nascend : Normally, the output given by this command is sorted\r\nso that the newest entries are displayed first, and the oldest at\r\nthe bottom of the list. If you use the ASCEND parameter, this\r\norder is reversed, displaying the oldest entries at the top. It is\r\nparticularly useful if you need to retrieve a very old log entry;\r\nif you needed something from six months ago, you\'d use \'days\r\n180 ascend\', and the output from that period would be at the\r\ntop. If you didn\'t use the ASCEND parameter it\'d be at the bottom,\r\nand quite likely truncated off due to the sheer number of lines.\r\n\r\n#6Some Examples of Usage:#0\r\n\r\nlog (port 4500) traithe : Will search the player port records for\r\nany ENTRY containing the word \'traithe\'. Note that if you\'re using\r\nthis command from the player port you needn\'t specify \'port\' as\r\na parameter, and that this will NOT return Traithe\'s commands.\r\n\r\nlog (account thorongil hours 24) sew OR knit : This will search the\r\nlogs for whichever port you\'re currently on for any entries created\r\nwithin the last 24 hours by any PC on Thorongil\'s account for \r\neither the term \'sew\' or the term \'knit\'.\r\n\r\nlog (room 2014 command kill) : This will search the logs for any\r\nusage of the kill command (no matter how it was entered, whether\r\nkIlL, kil, ki, KILL, etc.) that occurred in room 2014.\r\n\r\nlog (guest) application AND sucks : Will search the guest logs on \r\nyour current port for any entries containing BOTH the word \r\n\'application\' AND the word \'sucks\'.\r\n\r\nlog (room 129 minutes 30 ascend) : Will search the player logs\r\non your current port for any entries generated within room 129\r\nwithin the last 30 minutes, and display them in ascending order.\r\n\r\n','(null)',4,'Thursday, 01:30:52 am, 28th October 2004','Traithe'),
('Posting_policies','General','In Shadows of Isildur, there are essentially two types of in-character\r\nboards that we allow our players to post on in-game.\r\n\r\nThe first are \"gossip\" boards, often denoted by objects in game such\r\nas a table full of gossiping patrons, an errand boy relaying messages,\r\nand so forth. Posts on these types of boards should be oral in nature;\r\nsnippets of conversation that\'s passed along, perhaps some words\r\nexchanged between a couple of patrons at the bar, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe most important rule to bear in mind when using these \"gossip\"\r\nboards is to #1avoid using nameless and faceless vNPCs to convey\r\ncontroversial gossip or slander#0. Animating and assigning such\r\nopinions to non-players is the province of the admin staff only; if\r\nyou are found to be putting words in the mouths of NPCs in such a\r\nway, it will not be looked upon very kindly. Should you wish to\r\nconvey such information, you should do it in a manner that is ICly\r\ntraceable to your character; instead of \"Billy Joe Bob the nameless\r\npatron said...\", you should write, \"Jane stopped in and mentioned...\"\r\nIn other words, don\'t try to duck the in-character consequences of\r\nspreading negative information by using untraceable vNPCs. You can,\r\nhowever, slander yourself through the use of vNPCs as long as you\r\ndon\'t post anything that would get the NPC into serious trouble.\r\n\r\nThe second type of in-character board is a more traditional message\r\nboard, such as a bulletin board object. Instead of relaying bits and\r\npieces of gossip or conversations, posts on these boards should\r\nindeed be written as notes. Furthermore, only PCs with the proper\r\nliteracy skills should read from these boards or post to them.\r\n\r\nAny post placed on the boards in violation of the above policies will\r\nbe erased immediately by the admin staff upon discovery, and the\r\nplayer so in violation will be informed. If it becomes a repeated\r\noccurrence, possible sanctions include loss of posting privileges,\r\nloss of any accrued RPP, or other measures at the staff\'s discretion.\r\n\r\nIf you should happen to see a post on an in-character forum you\r\nbelieve to be breaking these rules, please inform the staff by sending\r\nan email to our staff list at staff@middle-earth.us.\r\n\r\n','Boards Policies Write',0,'Tuesday, 05:33:31 am, 12th June 2007','Nocht'),
('Travel','Movement','Usage: travel <string>\r\n\r\n The travel command allows you to specify a string that will be\r\n appended to your character\'s on-foot movements, similar to\r\n the way pmote works when you are stationary. Simply entering\r\n \"travel\" will display your current travel string, if any. Entering \r\n \"travel normal\" will clear the string if it is set, as will altering \r\n your walking speed.\r\n\r\n Travel strings allow you to express how your character is\r\n moving from one place to another to those that may be\r\n watching. As with pmote, the travel string can bring to the\r\n foreground any characteristic that would be obvious to the\r\n onlooker. Use the travel string to give your character a unique\r\n gait, or to draw attention to temporary affectations such as\r\n wounds or some item being worn. You should make sure that your\r\n travel matches your walking speed. For example, while the\r\n travel string \'with a deliberate swagger\' works when moving \r\n at a normal pace, it doesn\'t make sense if your character is \r\n sprinting.\r\n\r\n You may change your travel string on-the-fly when moving, \r\n similar to the way that you can override your voice string with\r\n speaking. Unlike overriding voice, you may not refer to objects\r\n and characters using the asterisk or tilde expansions. \r\n\r\n Syntax Examples:\r\n\r\n > travel limping heavily\r\n Your travel string has been set to: (limping heavily)\r\n\r\n > travel\r\n Your current travel string: (limping heavily)\r\n\r\n > north\r\n You begin walking northward, limping heavily.\r\n\r\n > north (glancing east across the Anduin River)\r\n You begin walking northward, glancing east across the Anduin River.\r\n\r\n','Dmote Emote Pmote Speed Voice',0,'Thursday, 03:00:14 pm, 25th November 2004','Erebus'),

Depending on what that object is, it may or may not\r\ndamage any target you specify. Of course, weapons designed for such\r\nuse will tend to be more effective, but any weapon, regardless of design,\r\nwill do a small amount of damage when successfully hurled at someone.\r\nOther objects, unless extremely weighty, will do no damage at all.\r\n\r\nYou will be able to identify weapons that are suitable for throwing by\r\n#6LOOK#0ing at them; a line will be appended to their full descriptions\r\nimmediately following what base skill they use, indicating as much.\r\n\r\nLike archery, you will not be able to throw at a target in an adjacent room\r\nunless you have sighted them first via SCAN. Unlike archery, there are no\r\nbuilt-in delays to this command. However, thrown weapons tend to be\r\nless damaging than their archery-based counterparts.\r\n\r\nThrowing works on the principle of balance. When your character throws\r\nan object, this will take him or her off-balance. While off-balance, any\r\nsubsequent throws are made with penalties to their skill checks, and will\r\nthrow you even further off-balance.

Most shopkeepers provide this facility; although they\r\nmay not have exactly what you need on-hand, chances are that if\r\nyou\'re looking for something similar to the majority of the items\r\nthey deal in, they will be able to acquire it for you.\r\n\r\nMost special orders take from 1-2 in-game weeks to arrive once\r\npaid for. The price for a special order is significantly higher than if\r\nyou purchased the item directly from a merchant or fellow PC, due\r\nto the effort required to obtain it on your behalf.\r\n\r\nOnce you place an order you will receive a merchandise ticket for\r\nthat order, which you may then GIVE back to the NPC shopkeeper\r\nafter the requisite waiting period has passed to redeem your items.\r\n\r\nThe ORDER LIST command is used to obtain a list of all available\r\nitems for order; like the standard LIST command, it can be given a\r\nkeyword argument to narrow its scope. ORDER BUY is then used to\r\nplace an order; the item must be referenced by the item number\r\npresent in the ORDER LIST, and not by a keyword or name.\r\n\r\nYou may also specify a quantity to order more than one at a time.\r\n\r\nFinally, for items with color variables ($drabcolor, $color and $fine-\r\ncolor), you may specify a color you would like to order the item in.\r\nFor a list, see ORDER DRABCOLORS, ORDER COLORS, and ORDER\r\nFINECOLORS, respectively.

('Materials','Building','Usage: mset materials <material tag>\r\n\r\nThe MATERIALS flags are used to tell NPC shopkeepers what sorts\r\nof items they deal in.

If no material flags are set, he will deal with any weapon.\r\n\r\nIn order for the code to accurately judge what material an object is\r\nmade of, you must include a material tag in the object\'s keyword\r\nlist when building it. These keywords MUST be in all caps, and they\r\nshould ideally be fairly far down the keyword list.\r\n\r\nSee #6TAGS MATERIALS#0 for an updated list of all material types.\r\n\r\nIf you fail to specify one, the code will gently remind you.\r\n\r\nRemember, the material tag represents what the item is primarily\r\nmade of. If it\'s made of more than one material, such as a pike, with\r\na metal head and a wooden haft, the material tag should be assigned\r\nto the \"more important\" part - in the pike\'s case, the metal head.\r\n\r\n','Classify Crafts Cset Tradesin',3,'Monday, 03:19:12 pm, 21st March 2005','Traithe'),

('Masons','Clans','#6The Fellowship of Masons:#0\r\n\r\nThe Masons of Minas Tirith have a long-standing rivalry with the\r\nWoodwrights. It dates back to the very earliest days of the White \r\nCity. Originally the Woodwrights were held in higher esteem, owing \r\nto the greater beauty of their craft and the elegance of the wood\r\nthey worked. The Masons built the city walls and towers, but the\r\ngreat houses and halls were made of strong wood and timber brought\r\nfrom a dozen different forests, each with a specific use. Galleries\r\nand screens of intricate fretwork bedecked the early city. However,\r\nas time passed and the houses needed renewing and replacing, the\r\nspecial timbers grew more and more expensive and harder to obtain.\r\nLong delays frustrated the grand designs of the few rich enough to\r\nbe able to afford them. Gradually, stone became more favored, not\r\nleast for its reliability and enduring qualities, and replaced many\r\nolder works of wood. At the same time, the Masons were themselves\r\nattracting more money and power with their increased patronage, and\r\ncould develop their craft to equal that of the joiners. Now the\r\nWoodwrights are less important, and few solely wooden buildings\r\nremain in Minas Tirith.\r\n\r\nGlassmakers occupy a branch in this Fellowship, and are mostly to be \r\nfound at the Glassworks on the Fifth Level of Minas Tirith. They make \r\nsmall-piece sheet glass for windows (which is too expensive for most \r\nhouses), bottles and other vessels, phials, cabinets, and cases, \r\nornaments, drinking ware and lenses, along with a host of other, rarer\r\nitems, usually  on a commission basis. Great skill is required of a \r\nglassblower or handler, and great artistry can also be exhibited in \r\ntheir craft. There is no Glassworks larger in the entirety of Gondor \r\nand Arnor than that of the White City.\r\n\r\nThe Potters\' sect, another branch of the broad Fellowship of Masons,\r\nis a loose and friendly one. Most potteries are small, dotted here \r\nand there about the city, with their own small kilns and wheels. Many \r\npottery goods are produced, including bowls, dishes, and every sort of \r\ntableware for the common folk of the city; troughs and basins for the \r\nbalconies, and the tiny, crammed gardens of city buildings wherein \r\nflowering plants are grown to brighten the streets; and so forth.\r\n\r\n','Fellowships',0,'Sunday, 12:21:12 pm, 28th May 2006','Erebus'),

('Retirement','General','In Shadows of Isildur, due to the time and care invested in each\r\nindividual character, suicide is highly frowned upon. For those\r\nplayers who find themselves simply not having fun any longer\r\nwith their current character, we usually advise that they somehow\r\nattempt to broaden that PC\'s horizons first. That is, try to find a\r\nnew job, make different friends, perhaps go on a few trips.\r\n\r\nHowever, we also realize that this is in fact a game, and it would\r\nbe a waste of everyone\'s time to ask people to continue playing\r\ncharacters they no longer enjoy. To that end, if you find your PC\r\nto be simply untenable and unsalvageable, you may choose to\r\nretire them automatically from the main account menu by\r\nchoosing option 4 - there is no need to suicide them in-game.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we do keep a list of who retires their characters,\r\nand thus players who are chronically prone to doing so will be\r\nhighly unlikely to receive roles with any responsibility or influence\r\nin the future, as we do not wish to have them easily abandoned.\r\n\r\nPlayers who retire their characters too often, or without good\r\ncause, may find a noretire flag on their accounts. \r\n\r\nWe do allow the unretirement of characters, provided several conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1) Players must have 2 roleplaying points to bring a character out of retirement.\r\n\r\n2) If the PC is a rpp race, the player must have the necessary rpp to create that race in order to unretire the character.\r\n\r\n3) This option may only be used if you have not unretired another character in the past six months.\r\n\r\n4) A background must be submitted for approval, explaining what your character has been doing during the absence and where they are.
