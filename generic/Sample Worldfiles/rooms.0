Club Endore~
   The walls of this chamber, tastefully panelled in rich, dark 
mahogany, lend the area a sophisticated, intimate feel. Tables 
are scattered about in the slightly lowered pit in the room's 
center, and large picture windows set into each of the walls look 
down over the virtual Middle-earth, far, far below. Muted 
laughter and conversation mingle on the air with the soft, 
drifting jazz melodies woven by the four-piece set playing on a 
raised stage in the southwestern corner. A long, polished bar of 
ebonwood runs along the northern wall, and the bartender directs 
the efforts of various servers who drift about the room over the 
dark, plush carpet, dressed in costumes resembling everything 
from bloodthirsty Orkish raiders to mithril-clad Elves. 
   A sign, etched in silver, hangs near one of the windows, and a 
gleaming mithril archway leads out to the south.

"sign silver"~
The sign reads:

        Type LOOK WINDOW to catch a glimpse of a random
        area of Middle-earth. Pointless, but endlessly
        amusing. Let us know if you notice anything odd!


                                   - Management,
                                     Club Endore

P.S. - If you are a newly-approved character looking to get into
       the gameworld proper, use the COMMENCE command to do so.

The Museum's Foyer~
   The absolutely cavernous central foyer of the Museum is a 
sharp contrast to the smaller, more intimate jazz club set in its 
northern wing. Fashioned of gleaming white marble lent a 
softened, bluish hue by the tastefully-arranged lighting 
fixtures, the walls are adorned by various paintings and murals 
depicting scenes from Middle-earth. Gracefully fluted columns 
form a ring about the very center of the foyer, where the 
mirror-like, smoky grey marble of the floor has been inlaid with 
a huge, painstakingly-etched map of Arda. 
   An arch to the north leads to the Museum's jazz club; ornate 
double doors set to the east bear a silver sign etched with the 
word 'History', and to the west, similar doors have been labeled 
in large letters with the word 'Peoples'. To the south, a pair 
of imposing double doors have been set.

The Ampitheatre~
   This colossal ampitheatre could easily seat an innumerable
number of people. Arrayed in a graceful circle, its tiered
rings slope down to a large stage in the very center. It is
fashioned in such a way that allows anything said at the
center, even the tiniest of whispers, to reach anyone seated
above quite clearly. Wrought in its entirety from the gleaming,
silver-veined white marble that comprises the rest of the
Museum, its sea of seats are upholstered in crushed velvet
dyed a deep indigo hue. A domed ceiling arches high above,
and countless lamps provide a soft, clear illumination.

The Junkyard~
   This is the room where all JUNKed items on the player port are

   Items stored here will automatically decay after one RL week,
unless picked up, in which case their timers will be removed.

A Private Room in Club Endore~
   Set aside for the private use of Club Endore's preferred 
clientele, this spacious sideroom shares the elegant mahogany 
panelling and plush dark carpeting of the rest of the 
establishment. Rich bronze sconces bearing muted lamps cast the 
area in a comfortable, low lighting. The air bears the faintest 
hint of the soft jazz melodies wafting through the thick walls 
from the main area of the club, and occasionally muted bits of 
conversation may be heard. The walls are lined with large glass 
picture windows, providing a breathtaking view of the star-filled 
void, and far, far below, the brilliant jewel-blue of Endore. 
Ornately-panelled double doors lead out into the hallway that 
will return one to the main area of the club.

   These panelled doors appear to be locked quite securely behind
you; why would you wish to return to the club, anyway? To visit
the main area, simply type "quit," and then choose the option to
log in as a Guest from the menu. Otherwise, to enter Middle-earth
itself and begin play, simply type #6COMMENCE#0.

The Sacred Glade of Aldaron, Lord of Trees~
   This shaded, cool forest glade is the sacred dwelling of Vala 
Orome, the Lord of Trees, also called Aldaron in the ancient 
language of the Quenya. A narrow, crystal-clear brook runs under 
a cluster of bending weeping willows, making a soft, trickling 
sound that soothes the senses of those fortunate enough to find 
shelter here. The chirping of multi-colored songbirds echoes 
merrily among the high branches of the golden mallorn trees, and 
the fragrance of wet grass and lovely asphodels and eglantines 
fills the air. An aura of peace and tranquility pervades this 
sacred place.
