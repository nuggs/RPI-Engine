dagger SIMPLE_QUALITY grimy blackened serrated METAL~
a blackened, serrated dagger~
A grimy, serrated dagger lies here, its blade blackened.~
   This dagger isn't much more than a jagged piece of metal 
mounted upon a small handle.  The blade is blackened with some 
sort of odd finish, and the whole thing is caked with grime.  It 
smells of old blood and damp metal.

a shoddy, tattered loincloth~
A shoddy tattered loincloth lies here in a smelly lump.~
   This loincloth has seen better days.  It's nothing more than 
a bunch of tattered leather strips and ripped cloth tied together 
with a total lack of skill and aesthetic objective.

a pair of rough, oily boots~
A pair of rough, oily boots lies here.~
   Rising just below mid-calf, this pair of darkened, leather
boots gleam with a certain unsightly grease.  Roll-tops trimmed
in scraggly, torn animal hair drape over the shin, the material
and fur stiffened from the tossed-up muck produced by the toils
of daily travel.

a cruel-looking leather whip~
A cruel-looking whip lies coiled here.~
   It is a wood-handled whip with a braided set of tails coming
out from it. Each tail is barbed along its length, ending in
a series of jagged leather tufts. It is a vicious, cruel
weapon designed to tear skin from flesh.

a ragged, flea-infested $drabcolor tunic~
A flea-infested pile of $drabcolor rags lies on the ground here.~
   This flea-infested, shoddy tunic sewn together out of various 
rags is somewhat itchy the touch and is most uncomfortable. 
While this garment can barely be called a tunic, it is made out 
of greasy, torn linen and is cut at the edges to allow the arms 
to stick through. The stitching holding this tunic together is 
quite clumsy and careless as it is coming loose any many places 
leaving bits of string sticking out.

a greasy bundle of rags~
A greasy bundle of rags and rope lies here.~
   It is a bundle of greasy rags, lashed together by twisted 
ropes. The ropes are looped around twice on one side, allowing 
the bundle to be slipped over a wearer's shoulders and worn on 
the back. It appears that some small objects can be stored away 
in the many folds of the rags.

a thick, flea-ridden, wolf fur cloak with a deep cowl~
A thick, pile of wolf furs lies crumpled on the ground here.~
   Heavy, sewn layers of fur overlap one another to make up this 
cloak. The cloak itself is not sewn by a master, but by a 
careless hand quickly whipping the pelts together for something 
to hide the wearer from the elements. Large holes in the coarse, 
black fur have been patched over where holes had been torn out of 
the cloak or the crafter was simply careless.

some filthy rags~
A pile of filthy rags is gathered here into a heap.~
   These rags have apparently once been a rather decent set of 
clothing. There is some evidence of a collar, as well as of a 
striped vertical pattern. The colors have all faded through 
eternal exposure to the sunlight, leaving grayish strips of cloth 
stained with oils, sweat, blood, and dirt. There are many holes, 
especially in the area that corresponds to the back, where there 
are horizontal whip-marks.

filthy rags of burlap~
Filthy rags made of burlap are gathered into a pile.~
   These rags have been furnished out of a large burlap bag so as 
to fit over the body. The bag has faded through eternal exposure 
to the sunlight, leaving grayish strips of cloth stained with 
oils, sweat, blood, and dirt. There are many holes, especially 
in the area that corresponds to the back, where there are 
horizontal whip-marks.

polearm pole-arm valgash BLACK NUMENOREAN wicked two-headed headed arm leather wrapped shaft GOOD_QUALITY LEATHER UNIQUE_BLACKWATCH~
a wicked, two-headed pole-arm with a leather wrapped shaft~
A wicked, two-headed pole-arm has been discarded here, its iron blade dirtied.~
   This heavy weapon has been constructed of dull iron forged 
into a heavy five foot long pole and then wrapped in black 
leather. At the end of the pole is a pair of crescent shaped 
blades coming to a sharp point in the middle. Resembling a twin 
headed glaive slightly a pair of a tassels are tied to where the 
head meets the haft. This weapon could likely function as a 
spear or a pole-arm and still function in a lethal fashion in 
either capacity.
