Base Room for Dwelling Zone~
The rooms in this zone are to be used STRICTLY for the master
floorplans that DWELLING objects use to create their areas.

A few things to remember. One: dwelling objects with the PITCHABLE
flag may only use one-room floorplans - tents and the like. Two:
other than that, your imagination's the limit. Floorplans can
basically be just like any other PC home you'd normally build.

After a dwelling object has cloned its floorplan into z100, the
cloned rooms can then be edited/modified to your heart's content
with regular builder commands without affecting the master, and
other dwellings of that same VNUM.

Lastly, all floorplans need to be isolated blocks of rooms -
they should NOT be linked to ANY OTHER AREA. EVER.
