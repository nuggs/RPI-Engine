A rough tunic of $drabcolor wool lies here in a heap.~
   This tunic, fashioned crudely if sturdily from $drabcolor
wool, looks none too comfortable. However, its heavy weave
provides resistance to the wear-and-tear oft encountered in the
daily lives of its wearers, and makes it suitable for use during
any of the year's seasons, whatever elements they bring to bear.

A pair of rough, $drabcolor homespun wool leggings lies here.~
   Crafted from rough, $drabcolor wool, these leggings are itchy 
and uncomfortable at best. The stitching is of average quality, 
so these leggings are cheap, but they are certainly practical for 
all seasons. They lace up the sides, making them easy to adjust.

   Made from rough, $drabcolor wool, this cloak is practical and 
warm. The stitching is of average skill, yet the hems are not 
frayed or damaged. A deep hood provides some protection from the 
elements, and the cloak itself clasps about the wearer's 
shoulders with a dull iron cloakpin.

long walks.

A sharp-looking knife with a wooden handle lies here.~
   This plain, wood-handled knife is more functional than 
decorative. The iron blade is clean and sharp, and the single 
cutting edge glints in the light. The wooden handle is cross- 
hatched to allow a firmer grip. This knife would be useful at 
the dinner table, or as a tool, but would be of little use in 
battle.

A long, iron trident lies here, its prongs sharp and wicked looking.~
   Three wide prongs jut from the head of this wicked-looking 
iron trident. The longer center prong has an arrowhead-like tip 
on the end, while the outer two, each curving slightly toward the 
center, are barbed on the outer edge to snag and hold once the 
weapon is thrust into its target. The iron head is engraved with 
elaborate knotwork designs, the deeper engravings blackened from 
age. The trident's head is attached to a long, hardwood shaft, 
requiring the use of both hands to wield it properly.

   This is little more than a $drabcolor strip of cloth. The 
fabric is tough, and has been sewed together twisted. There are 
a few loose threads hanging from the edges, and some patches seem 
almost threadbare.

A brown burlap bag with a fraying rope strap lies here.~
   The burlap cloth that makes up this bag is rough to the touch, 
made up of strong woven hemp fibres. Stitching, done with thick 
string, joins the two halves of the material together, a similar 
brown colour to that of the burlap. A coarse, fraying rope has 
been attatched to the bag for easier transportation. The bag is 
strong enough to carry quite a load for its size.
