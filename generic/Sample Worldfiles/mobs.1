a young, mischievous-looking boy~
A young, mischievous-looking boy skips brightly along the thoroughfare.~
   Humming beneath his breath as he skips along, this young,
blonde-headed lad seems quite carefree. Slight, ghostly hollows
in his cheeks and a few bruises on his arms, however, hint at
a less-than-delicate lifestyle, and his large green eyes seem
to flit restlessly from person to person, as if he never quite
feels at ease. He is also rather dirty, and quite unkempt.

A formless commoner prototype is here, looking lost.~
   This commoner hustles and bustles about their daily errands, 
drifting from shop to shop and street to street beneath the 
ever-present silhouette of Minas Tirith's gallant Citadel. 
Fairly well-kept if not opulently wealthy, one has the impression 
that even the commoners in the city are mostly well provided for 
by their trade and their Fellowship.

a formless enforcer prototype~
A formless enforcer prototype is here, looking lost.~
   This attentive guard patrols the streets of the city of Minas
Tirith, watching carefully for a disturbance of the peace. Eyes
slightly narrowed and lips set into a grim line, they appear
quite serious about upholding their sworn duty. They move in
stone-cold silence, having precious little time for conversation.

A well-tanned man with snowy-white hair is here, stripping a frond.~
   With his bronze complexion and bleached-white hair, this 
elderly gentleman has likely spent many of his days harvesting 
reeds from the banks of the Anduin. His large hands are scarred 
with many healed lesions inflicted by the sharp ends of the reeds 
which he must cut for his business.
