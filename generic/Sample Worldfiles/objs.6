longsword SIMPLE_QUALITY dark serrated sword iron bone-hilted METAL METAL~
a serrated, bone-hilted iron longsword~
A dark iron longsword with a serrated edge is set on the ground.~
   Five foot long and straight, this blade is fashioned of dark 
iron into a functional and harsh weapon. With a hilt of fastened 
bone, a crude cross guard and short quillons, this is a simple, 
crudely fashioned example of the orkish foundries. Besides the 
damage it would deal on itself, its maker serrated the edges, as 
to deliver a grievous, evil wound. This lends a horrific aspect 
to the blade, but clearly diminishes its overall endurance.

shortsword SIMPLE_QUALITY wide bladed sword METAL METAL~
a wide-bladed, iron shortsword~
A sword with a wide blade of black iron lies discarded.~
   More akin to a shortsword than anything, this sword is made of 
thick, hammered iron, which has become dark and rusty. The blade 
is wider than the ones usually seen in this type of weapon, and 
ensures a long, gaping wound. Used for thrusts, the hilt is but 
a piece of wood bolted with screws. The hand is somewhat 
protected by a seemingly strong cross guard, fashioned from the 
blade itself. Engraved into the iron, the symbol of a fiery, 
lidless eye betrays the orkish origin of the weapon.

scimitar SIMPLE_QUALITY black-bladed iron curved sword METAL METAL~
a simple, black-bladed, iron scimitar~
A sword with a curved blade of black iron has been left here.~
   Forged of simple iron, this weapon is long and functional, 
with a curving blade that allows its bearer to deliver fast 
slices to his enemies. Despite this, the edge appears dulled and 
hardly dangerous, forcing the wielder to rely more on strength 
than skill. A perpendicular strip of metal has been melted into 
the leather-wrapped hilt to serve it as a cross guard.

broadsword SUB_QUALITY crude iron black METAL METAL~
a crude iron broadsword~
A crude broadsword with a blade made of iron rests in the ground.~
   Crafted from stained iron, this sword sports a heavy, broad 
blade, capable of dealing quite an amount of damage from the 
combination of edge, weight and skill of the owner. With a 
strong cross guard and secure wooden handle, the overall 
construction of this weapon could yield a deadly weapon, but the 
smith apparently just fashioned it without taking time to finish 
the edge or polish the blade. The pommel, a circular piece of 
iron, bears a symbol of a fiery, lidless eye.

battlesword battle-sword PROFICIENT_QUALITY UNIQUE_URUK_HAI thick iron METAL sword~
a thick, iron battle-sword~
A thick, iron battle-sword with a heavy wooden pommel lies here in the dust.~
   With a thick blade and almost six foot long, this weapon is a 
fearsome one, designed to kill or maim easily. Of dark iron, the 
edge is sharp, but certainly the damage is caused from the 
strength of it's owner and the overall weight of the weapon. Set 
near the hilt is a strong cross guard, made of polished copper, 
that matches the dark leather wrapping the handle tightly. 
   On the pommel, a heavy medallion counterbalances the swing and 
depicts a fiery, lidless eye, betraying the origin of this blade.

spear SUB_QUALITY slightly-rusted ill-formed METAL METAL~
an ill-formed spear with a slightly-rusted head~
An ill-formed, slightly-rusted spear has been discarded here.~
   The head having crudely forged of black iron and then roughly 
sharpened, it now lies attached to a long pole of hardened ash. 
The wood has darkened from use, and the light tinges of rust have 
begun to form around the spear head, a clear sign of a lack of 
treatment. Without any kind of finesse, this weapon is a crude 
one, barely a step ahead of a sharpened pole.

A pair of plain, $drabcolor baggy pants is lying here.~
   This plain pair of $drabcolor pants has been sewn from thin, 
rough material. The legs billow out at the knees, and tightly 
twisted drawstrings secure the garment at the waist and ankles, 
allowing it to be easily adjusted. The ends of the cords have 
been knotted to keep them from coming loose.
