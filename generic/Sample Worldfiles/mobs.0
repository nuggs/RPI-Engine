a goofy-looking man~
A goofy-looking man stands here, drooling and gazing about vapidly.~
A rather vapid-looking fellow, this man's chin is drenched in 
drool and loose spittle.  His low brow barely reaches an inch 
above his eyes, and he keeps his hands clasped behind his back.

norman the Newbie~
Norman the Newbie stands here, looking lost.~
Norman is a newbie of nervous disposition.  He knows you're 
going to send him into nasty places where he will likely die; and 
he disapproves of it intensely.  Not a lot he can do about it 
though.

fuzzy black spider small~
a fuzzy, black spider~
A small, fuzzy black spider creeps around its glistening web.~
   Thin, furry legs stem out from the fat, almost perfectly 
spherical, fuzzy body of this arachnid.  Its movements seem 
quite paced, save the occasional leap toward prey, or scurried 
defense.  A single red stripe trails from between twelve beady, 
fiery eyes down its coal-black body.

eagle enormous maple-feathered~
an enormous, maple-feathered eagle~
An enormous eagle with maple-colored feathers perches nearby.~
   Cautiously peering about its surroundings with keen, 
pine-green eyes, this giant bird of prey stands tall and proud.  
Sleek, maple-brown feathers, glimmering in the right light, 
delicately cover its form from head to tail.  Ruffled, shorter 
feathers of a darker brown protect its sturdy legs to its claws - 
talons hard and sharp.  This eagle's movements are extremely 
quick and fluid, despite its immense size, as it soars rapidly 
and with much ease or simply perches serenely at a cliff or on a 
tree limb.

a jet-black fox with a silver-tipped tail~
A jet-black fox with a silver-tipped tail is here.~
   Majestic in appearance, this fox has a beautiful lustrous 
jet-black coat and an eye-catching tail that ends in a silver 
tip. Its pointy muzzle has a tiny black nose that is always 
located low to the ground so as to sniff out any potential prey. 
The fox is very quick and nimble, and seems to have some sort of 
ability to sense anyone coming too close, making it very hard to 
catch.

a rather annoyed spider variable~
A rather annoyed spider variable rests here malignantly~
   This spider is of freakish proportions, weighing around eighty 
pounds and roughly the size of a large horse. Thick, coarse hair 
covers the creature's entire body, from long, spindly legs to 
fat, corpulent thorax. Eight ink-black eyes look out at the 
world, merciless and malignant. From the creature's head a pair 
of oversized mandibles protrude, razor-sharp.
