Western Corner of the Arena~
   This gargantuan arena is incredibly intimidating, especially 
from this vantage point. The cruel and mocking screams and 
taunts of the crowd seem to add to the unpleasantness of this 
vast, dirty, muddy and quite heinous battleground. The ground 
here is not just stained, but instead soaked and permeated with 
endless amounts of blood, both fresh and old. The smell of 
rotting flesh and fermenting bodily fluids encompasses this 
entire place.

Southwestern Corner of the Arena~
   Stained pink by the constant shower of blood, the smooth heavy 
granite walls tower above the dusty sand-covered arena. The 
roaring spectators, sitting upon the rows of benches on top of 
the walls keep hurling various unsavory articles of food upon the 
contestants in the pit. Orcs and humans, as well as various 
terrifying beasts trample through the pit, attacking each other 
with fists, teeth, and weapons, and spraying the audience with 
searing, dark-red blood. Various body parts, with a fresh scent 
still about them, litter the corner of the arena.

Southeastern Corner of the Arena~
   Here lies the southeastern segment of the vast arena. The 
immense noise of the crowd is deafening, and though no 
specifically distinguishable remarks can be heard, it is quite 
apparent that most of them are unpleasant and mocking. The 
ground here is littered with broken weapon and armour fragments, 
many of them hazardously protruding from the ground in a most 
dangerous manner. The air here is moist and thick, as if 
permeated with the salty sweat of the combatants.

Eastern Corner of the Arena~
   The heavy, grey-granite bleachers tower over the occupants of 
the enclosed, well-lit arena. The walls have been smoothly 
sanded, preventing any attempts to escape the arena. Several 
wide, greased stone columns tower around the perimeter of the 
pit, allowing the searing flames at their pinnacles to alight the 
blood-stained sands. The metallic chimes of weapon hitting upon 
weapon intermingle with the agonizing screams accompanying the 
hacking and dismemberment of the contestants' flesh. The viewers 
sitting at the bleachers are armed with various disfigured 
articles of food, as well as the occasional weapon; they 
repeatedly pelt the gladiators, attempting to influence the fight 
in some manner or other.

Northeastern Corner of the Arena~
   The northeastern part of the arena seems to be the most 
blood-soaked, if that is possible. The muddy and dirty ground is 
neither brown, nor black, but instead a dark, rich blood-red. 
The stench of sweat, grime and other unpleasant bodily fluids 
sifts through the air in horrid, potent streams. Along with the 
smell, the curses and screams of angry spectators urge on whoever 
they have bet upon. The ground is so wet here that an almost 
quicksand like effect has been achieved - it would be wise not to 
stand too long in one place.

Northwestern Corner of the Arena~
   This whole area is covered with a coarse rust colored dirt.
It is very trampled, probably from the people and creatures
fighting for their lives.  Many a soul has fallen in this arena,
all for the entertainment of the bloodthirsty denizens of Mordor.
They rise to their feet, bets and excitement the only thing on 
their minds.  The walls are made of a very thick granite - 
scratched, bloodstained, and beaten so much that it is chipped
and nearly falling.  Stands exist above the arena, where the
sadists of Mordor can enjoy their bloodlust in relative safety.
The arena continues east and south of here for quite some
distance.

At the Archway to Enter the Pit~
   A crossroads of sorts, this wide, dark hallway branches three 
ways. Cold, dark granite floors the way north and south, towards 
cells for the condemned combatants, each kept in painful 
anticipation for what very well be their last minutes alive. A 
wide ramp leads up to the east, sounds of unmerciful cheers and 
mayhem billowing down the expanse at gametimes, a near roar that 
enters the preparatory rooms of the arena, and seems to 
reverberate down the stonewalled hall. It stands agape like a 
giant horror's jaws, the only admittance to near certain death, 
and the gruesome horrors that await each person who travel 
through the gate's iron teeth.

Rows of Stone Benches Over-Looking a Large Pit-Fighting Arena~
   The uncomfortable, rocky stone benches that line this place 
overlook a rather large pit-fighting arena. The arena itself 
seems to be muddy and quite revolting, stained continually with 
spilled blood and other unpleasant bodily fluids. The seats 
themselves are not much better of a sight, being stained with 
unknown and probably unimaginable liquids. The cruel sounds and 
shouts of gambling seem to float through the air from the west. 
A blood-red curtain bars the passage northward, seeming to 
enclose a balcony of some sort.

A Balcony Overhang High Above the Arena~
   This balcony leans high over the arena, but not at an altitude 
too severe to witness the brutal and bloody action below. The 
sounds of skirmish and battle rise up as the deafening noise of 
the crowd surges and swells like a great ocean tide. The 
visibility these seats offer is quite excellent, a better vantage 
point not being easily discernable. A large red curtain 
delineates the southern origins of this place, and serves as a 
barrier between the outer corridor and the balcony.

Arena Seating near a Large Betting Area~
   This section of the arena seating is very near to a large 
gambling area. The loud, obnoxious sounds of yells and shouts of 
bets and cancellations, minor arguments and full-fledged brawls 
can be made out from the mass of people attempting to double or 
triple their money. The action in the arena is quite downplayed 
and droned out by this seemingly violent, yet almost ritualistic 
spectacle. A large balcony can be seen jutting out to the 
northeast, though it seems to be for the use of the powerful and 
important only.
